# Introduction #

As the Latine population increased in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, during the 1900s due to migration work provided by the emergency Farm Labor Program (1943) and the Bracero Treaty (1951-1961), many Mexicans settled in Wisconsin by the 1970s. Additionally, there was an increase in Tejanos moving to Wisconsin due to farm labor programs. Therefore Wisoncon also saw an influx of Chicanos from Texas (The Tejano Diaspora : Mexican Americanism and Ethnic Politics in Texas and Wisconsin, pg 4-6). Puerto Ricans began to migrate to Wisconsin during the 1940s, becoming the second biggest migrant group in the state besides Mexicans. 
By the 1970s, there were settled communities of Mexican-American and Puerto Ricans in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Many US Latines were dealing with issues like social, economic, educational, and identity issues around the US, not excluding those living in Wisconsin. Therefore, it became vital that the Mexican and Puerto Rican communities had an outlet to spread the issues encountered in Wisconsin by these minority groups. 

The creation of media outlets like Newspapers was essential in uncovering the unjust treatment of US Latines in education, labor, and society. But these newspapers were essentially promoting cultural identity by promoting music, radio, tv programs, business, and other social events. 

Latin American Union for Civil Rights in Milwaukee published the Newspaper La Guardia from 1969-1982, it is a bilingual paper published both in English and Spanish. It advocated for education, labor, and social rights. Additionally, the newspaper provides a place for the US Latine to develop their community and identity.

# Education #

Milwaukee's education system underserved the Mexican-American and Puerto Rican student communities. K-12 students did not receive proper attention from the school district. For example, testing did not consider the impact of being a Spanish speaker, students did not receive adequate attention in subjects like English, Math, and Sciences, and there was a lack of college preparation. Latine-serving high schools, like South Division and Lincoln High, had the highest dropout rates, and South Division was considered the worst school in Milwaukee. Additionally, University students also faced struggles in higher academia. The grading system did not benefit the Black, Latine, and Native students like their white counterparts. The Wisconsin University did not initially provide support to help their Latine students succeed.

La Guardia needed to cover these issues and give a spotlight to students advocating for their education. K-12 educators in predominantly Mexican-American and Puerto Rican schools like South Division and Lincoln High organized walk out for their students during Mexico's and Puerto Rico's Independence Day. Social Justice groups and advocates like the Brown Berets and Lalo Valdez (a writer/editor in La Guardia and advocate in Milwaukee) further organized these walkouts by speaking to the students about the Latine struggle and their histories, like Mexican and Puerto Rico's Independence Day and providing entertainment. Walkouts gave students a sense of community, whether they were Mexican or Puerto Rican, they faced similar struggles and advocated for one another. The walkouts educated students on their history with speeches and entertainment, furthering their education but also protesting against their education system. 

The Latine community and Higher education students contributed to protesting for better resources and education by institutions like the University of Wisconsin Madison and the University of Marquette. These institutions had a responsibility to serve the Latine community. The community urged UWM to work with prospective students when applying for college, financial support, and resources to current students. Additionally, graduate students advocated for Affirmative Action Programs and inclusion of Latine, Black, and Native students in the curriculum. 

La Guardia highlighted events outside the Wisconsin community to provide an example of the possibilities of improvement of education for the Latine community. For example, they covered a case from Crystal City, Texas, in which La Raza Unida Party was able to make changes in the school board. The actions they took were providing bilingual education for K-3rd grade children, the end of IQ and English proficiency tests due to the negative effects on Spanish-speaking students, free breakfast and lunch for all schools, and more. La Guardia wanted to motivate the community by depicting possible changes occurring in different states.

        Farm work and other job opportunities brought many Mexicans and Puerto Ricans to Milwaukee. Their need for a job removed them from their home and to navigate a new culture. Unfortunately, the jobs were not well paid, lacked proper working conditions, and did not meet the needs of the migrants. <a href="objects/utblac_independentvoices_laguardia_vol.2_no.7_pg.2.JPG">La Guardia</a> covered many of these boycotts, migrant bills, and outrages seen throughout the 70s.

        Migrant works led many protests due to poor working conditions. <a href="objects/utblac_independentvoices_laguardia_vol.7_no.11_pg.4.JPG">Some of these protests</a> were held by the State Capital to advocate for farmworkers. Additionally, factory workers dealt with poor wages and equity issues, also led to walk-outs and protests. Luckily the protesting led for the Labor Grant and Migrant bill being passed, leading to better benefits for workers.
